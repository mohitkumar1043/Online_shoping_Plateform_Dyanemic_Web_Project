Online Shopping Project Using Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and MySQL

OVERVIEW
This project integrates several core Java EE technologies,
including Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Database Con‐
nectivity (JDBC), and MySQL for database management. The
combination of these technologies ensures a robust, dynamic,
and scalable solution for managing online shopping activities.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Servlets: Used for handling client requests and responses.
managing the flow of data between the view (JSP) and the
model (database).
JSP (JavaServer Pages):JSP files contain HTML and Java code,
allowing for dynamic content generation.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):JDBC is used to execute SQL
queries and interact with the MySQL database.
MySQL: The database system used to store and manage the
application’s data. MySQL provides a reliable and efficient way
to handle large datasets.
